# Project GALGO

This project was born out of the need of making a project for Interactive Systems subject in ESI UCLM plus the will of helping someone. The main target are the shelters, so they can manage all the information they have into an app which will collect every animal data. At the moment, the data includes their name, chip number, and other data like any disease, reasons to be there and any helping note on how to behave with them. 

## Target Functionalities

- List view display of every animal with some important information about each one in their own tile aside with a photo of the animal.
- Form view of every specified information for the animal.
- NFC read from NFC tag to open directly the animal information.
- NFC write to NFC tag to create new animal forms in case a new animal arrives to the shelter.
- Possibility to choose the photo for each animal.

## Technologies used

Right now, the only technologies used are:
- Dart/Flutter.
- flutter_nfc_kit package for Dart.

If needed, more will be added.

## Purpose

This app has NO INTENTION of getting any type of revenue. Its purpose is purely educative and, in case it can be distributed, it will be free and open source for any shelter or person willing to give it a use.
